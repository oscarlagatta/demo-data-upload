# US Wire Transfer Payment Processing System - Wireflow Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive wireflow for the US Wire Transfer Payment Processing System, designed with US user expectations and cultural cues in mind. The system handles end-to-end wire transfer processing, from payment initiation through clearing and settlement, with integrated fraud detection, compliance screening, and reporting capabilities.

## System Overview

The wire transfer processing system consists of 25 major components organized into 6 functional layers:
1. **External Integration Layer** - Partner systems and external interfaces
2. **Payment Entry & Validation Layer** - Initial payment processing and validation
3. **Account & Transaction Layer** - Account management and transaction posting
4. **Core Processing Layer** - Central clearing and settlement engine
5. **Compliance & Risk Layer** - Fraud detection, AML, and sanctions screening
6. **Clearing & Settlement Layer** - External clearing networks (Fed/Wire, CHIPS)
