# User Story: Add Payment Flow Diagrams for APAC Region

## Story ID
**FLOW-APAC-001**

## User Story
**As a** Payment Operations Manager monitoring APAC transactions  
**I want** to view interactive flow diagrams for China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Korea payment systems  
**So that** I can monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize payment processing across these critical APAC markets

---

## Business Context

### Background
The current payment health monitoring system supports US Wire transfers. To expand our APAC operations and provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities, we need to add support for four key markets:

1. **China** - Domestic RMB payments via CNAPS (China National Advanced Payment System)
2. **Taiwan** - TWD payments via FISC (Financial Information Service Co.)
3. **Malaysia** - MYR payments via RENTAS (Real-time Electronic Transfer of Funds and Securities)
4. **Korea** - KRW payments via KFTC (Korea Financial Telecommunications & Clearings Institute)

### Business Value
- **Market Coverage**: Enable monitoring of 4 additional APAC markets representing $X billion in annual transaction volume
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce incident resolution time by 40% through visual flow monitoring
- **Compliance**: Meet regional regulatory requirements for transaction monitoring and reporting
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improve payment success rates and reduce customer complaints

### Priority
**High** - Required for Q2 2025 APAC expansion initiative
